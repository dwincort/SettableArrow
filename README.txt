SETTABLE ARROWS

Copyright (c) Daniel Winograd-Cort 2014

This file provides code to accompany the ICFP paper "Settable and 
Non-Interfering Signal Functions for FRP" (see citation below).

As a sample instantiation of Arrow, we use a function automaton drawn 
from the ArrowTransformers library.  We then set up the settability 
data types and show the transformation as a set of type classes.  Finally, 
we provide some small demonstations.
